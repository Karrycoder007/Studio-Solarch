            Every site here is engineered in Next.js and TypeScript, styled with Tailwind CSS,
            and animated with GSAP — chosen because they load fast, hold up under real traffic,
            and don't lock you into a page-builder that gets slower and harder to maintain as
            it grows.

          <p className="font-body text-base md:text-lg opacity-80 leading-relaxed">
            Photography and film are shot on-location, not sourced from stock libraries. And
            because one person handles design, development, and delivery, there's no handoff
            between departments — the same eye that shoots the images is the same hand that
            builds the site around them.
